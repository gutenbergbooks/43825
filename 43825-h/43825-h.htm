<h3><a name="KING_JOHN_AND_THE_ABBOT_OF_CANTERBURY" id="KING_JOHN_AND_THE_ABBOT_OF_CANTERBURY">KING JOHN AND THE ABBOT OF CANTERBURY.</a></h3>


<p>Stories resembling that contained in the following
ballad are to be met with in the literature of most of
the nations of Europe; for example, in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,
(No. XIX. and [XXXV.] of Madden's <i>Old
English Versions</i>,) in the amusing German tale <i>Der
Phaffe Amis</i>, 98-180, in <i>Eulenspiegel</i>, (Marbach, p.
28,) and the English <i>Owlglass</i> (31st Adventure in the
recent edition), in the Grimm's <i>Kinder-und-Haus-marchen</i>,
No. 152, in Sacchetti's <i>Novels</i>, No. 4, the <i>Patrañuelo</i>
of Juan Timoneda, Alcala, 1576 (Ritson, <i>Anc.
Songs</i>, ii. 183), the <i>Contes à rire</i>, i. 182, (<i>Gent. Mag.</i>
65, i. 35,) etc., etc. <i>King John and the Abbot</i>, says
Grundtvig (ii. 650), is universally known in Denmark
in the form of a prose tale; and a copy is printed in
<i>Gamle danske Minder</i> (1854) No. 111, <i>The King and
the Miller</i>.</p>

<p>Wynken de Worde, printed in 1511, a little collection
of riddles, translated from the French, like those
propounded by King John to the Abbot, with the title
<i>Demaundes Joyous</i>. By this link the present ballad
is connected with a curious class of compositions, peculiar
to the Middle Ages&mdash;the Disputations, or Wit-Combats,
of which the dialogues of Salomon and
Marcolf (existing in many languages) are the most
familiar, and those of Salomon and Saturn (in Anglo-Saxon)
the oldest preserved specimens. These
dialogues, in their earlier shape grave contests for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
superiority in knowledge and wisdom, underwent a
change about the twelfth century, by which they
became essentially comic. The serious element, represented
by Salomon, was retained after this, merely
to afford material, or contrast, for the coarse humor of
Marcolf, whose part it is, under the character of a
rude and clownish person, "facie deformis et turpissimus,"
to turn the sententious observations of the
royal sage into ludicrous parodies.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The hint, and possibly a model, for these disputations
may have been found in Jewish tradition. We
learn from Josephus, (<i>Antiquities</i>, Book VIII. ch. v.)
that Hiram of Tyre and Solomon sent one another
sophistical puzzles and enigmas to be solved, on condition
of forfeiting large sums of money in case of
failure, and that Solomon's riddles were all guessed
by Abdæmon of Tyre, or by Abdimus, his son, for
authorities differ. This account coincides with what
we read in <i>Chronicles</i>, (Book II. ch. ii. 13, 14,) of the
man sent by Hiram to Solomon, who, besides a universal
knowledge of the arts, was skilful "to find out
every device that might be put to him" by cunning
men&mdash;that is, apparently, "hard questions," such as
the Queen of Sheba came to prove Solomon with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
(1 Kings, x. i.) some account of which is given in
the <i>Talmud</i>.&mdash;See, on the whole subject, Kemble's
masterly essay on <i>Salomon and Saturn</i>, printed by
the Ælfric Society: also Grässe, <i>Sagenkreise des Mittelalters</i>,
p. 406-471; the Grimms' <i>Kinder-und-Hausmärchen</i>,
vol. iii. p. 236, ed. 1856; F. W. V. Schmidt,
<i>Taschenbuch deutscher Romanzen</i>, p. 82.</p>

<p>Examples of the riddle-song pure and simple will
be found under <i>Captain Wedderburn's Courtship</i>.</p>

<p>This ballad is taken from Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 329.
The copy in Durfey's <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>, iv.
29, or <i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, ii. 49, is vastly
inferior to the present.</p>

<p>"The common popular ballad of <i>King John and
the Abbot</i>," says Percy, "seems to have been abridged
and modernized about the time of James I., from one
much older, entitled <i>King John and the Bishop of
Canterbury</i>. The Editor's folio MS. contains a copy
of this last, but in too corrupt a state to be reprinted;
it however afforded many lines worth reviving, which
will be found inserted in the ensuing stanzas.</p>

<p>"The archness of the following questions and answers
hath been much admired by our old ballad-makers;
for besides the two copies above mentioned,
there is extant another ballad on the same subject,
(but of no great antiquity or merit,) entitled <i>King
Olfrey and the Abbot</i>. [<i>Old Ball.</i> ii. 55.] Lastly,
about the time of the civil wars, when the cry ran
against the bishops, some puritan worked up the same
story into a very doleful ditty, to a solemn tune, concerning
<i>King Henry and a Bishop</i>; with this stinging
moral:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Unlearned men hard matters out can find,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When learned bishops princes eyes do blind.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Among those nations who originated and developed the
character of Marcolf (the German and the French) his fame
has declined, but in Italy, where the legend was first introduced
towards the end of the sixteenth century, his shrewd
sayings, like the kindred jests of the <i>Eulenspiegel</i> in Germany,
have an undiminished popularity, and his story, both
in the form of a chap-book and of a satirical epic, (the <i>Bertoldo</i>,)
is circulated throughout the length and breadth of
the country, whence it has also been transplanted into
Greece.</p></div>

<p>The two following ballads, in connection with the
foregoing, will serve as specimens of the anciently
highly-popular class of riddle songs. No ballad, says
Motherwell, is even now more frequently met with on
the stalls than <i>Captain Wedderburn's Courtship</i>. It
was first published in <i>The New British Songster</i>, Falkirk,
1785, and afterwards in Jamieson's <i>Popular
Ballads</i>, ii. 154, from which the present copy is taken.
Chambers gives a few different readings from a copy
furnished by Mr. Kinloch&mdash;<i>Scottish Ballads</i>, p. 331.</p>

<p>A fragment of this piece is given in <i>Minstrelsy
of the English Border</i>, p. 230, under the title of <i>The
Laird of Roslin's Daughter</i>. Riddles like those in the
following ballads are found in <i>Proud Lady Margaret</i>,
p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a> of this volume, <i>The Courteous Knight</i>, in the
Appendix, and <i>The Bonny Hind Squire</i>, in <i>Scottish
Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads</i>, p. 42, Percy
Society, vol. xvii.&mdash;three varieties of one original:
and in <i>Gifts from over Sea</i>, Appendix, p. 290. Also,

<h3><a name="KING_EDWARD_FOURTH_AND_THE_TANNER" id="KING_EDWARD_FOURTH_AND_THE_TANNER">KING EDWARD FOURTH AND THE TANNER
OF TAMWORTH.</a></h3>


<p>The next two ballads belong to a class of tales extremely
numerous in England, in which the sovereign
is represented as conversing on terms of good fellowship
with one of his humbler subjects who is unacquainted
with the royal person. In several of the best
of these stories, the monarch is benighted in the forest,
and obliged to demand hospitality of the first man he
meets. He is at first viewed with suspicion and
treated with rudeness, but soon wins favor by his affability
and good humor, and is invited to partake of a
liberal supper, composed in part of his own venison.
In due time the king reveals his true character to his
astonished and mortified host, who looks to be punished
alike for his familiarity and for deer-stealing,
but is pardoned for both, and even handsomely rewarded
for his entertainment.</p>

<p>The earliest of these stories seems to be that of King
Alfred and the Neatherd, in which the herdsman's
wife plays the offending part, and the peasant himself
is made Bishop of Winchester. Others of very considerable
antiquity are the tales of Henry II. and the
Cistercian Abbot in the <i>Speculum Ecclesiæ</i> of Giraldus
Cambrensis, (an. 1220,) printed in <i>Reliquiæ Antiquæ</i>,
i. 147; <i>King Edward and the Shepherd</i>, and <i>The
King</i> [Edward] <i>and the Hermit</i>, in Hartshorne's <i>Metrical
Tales</i>, (p. 35, p. 293, the latter previously in <i>The
British Bibliographer</i>, iv. 81;) <i>Rauf Coilzear, how he
harbreit King Charlis</i>, in Laing's <i>Select Remains; John
the Reeve</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> an unprinted piece in the Percy MS., founded
on an adventure between King Edward I. and one
of his bailiffs, which is highly commended by Dr. Percy
"for its genuine humor, diverting incidents, and faithful
picture of rustic manners;" and <i>The King and the
Barker</i>, the original of the present ballad. (See also
the seventh and eighth fits of the <i>Little Gest of Robin
Hood</i>.) More recent specimens are the two pieces
here given, and others mentioned by Percy: <i>King
Henry and the Soldier</i>, <i>King Henry VIII. and the
Cobbler</i>, <i>King James I. and the Tinker</i>, <i>King William
and the Forester, &amp;c.</i> It is obvious that a legend of
immemorial antiquity has been transferred by successive
minstrels or story-tellers to the reigning monarch
of their own times. An anecdote of the same character
is related by Mr. Wright of Prince George of
Denmark, and a poor artisan of Bristol, (<i>Essays</i>, ii.
172.)</p>

<p>The meeting of King Richard with Friar Tuck
in Ivanhoe, was suggested by the tale of <i>King Edward
and the Hermit</i>. "The general tone of the
story," says Scott, "belongs to all ranks and to all
countries, which emulate each other in describing the
rambles of a disguised sovereign, who, going in
search of information or amusement into the lower
ranks of life, meets with adventures diverting to the
reader or hearer, from the contrast betwixt the monarch's
outward appearance and his real character.
The Eastern tale-teller has for his theme the disguised
expeditions of Haroun Alraschid, with his
faithful attendants Mesrour and Giafar, through the
midnight streets of Bagdad, and Scottish tradition
dwells upon the similar exploits of James V., distin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>guished
during such excursions by the travelling
name of the Goodman of Ballengeigh, as the Commander
of the Faithful, when he desired to be <i>incognito</i>,
was known by that of Il Bondocani."</p>

<p><i>The King and the Barker</i> is printed in Ritson's <i>Anc.
Pop. Poetry</i>, p. 61; the modern ballad of <i>King Alfred
and the Shepherd</i>, in <i>Old Ballads</i>, i. 41; <i>King James
and the Tinkler</i>, in Richardson's <i>Borderer's Table Book</i>,
vii. 8, and in the Percy Soc. Publications, vol. xvii.,
<i>Ancient Poems, &amp;c.</i> p. 109.</p>

<p>"The following text is selected (with such other
corrections as occurred) from two copies in black letter.
The one in the Bodleian library, entitled <i>A merrie,
pleasant, and delectable historie betweene King
Edward the Fourth, and a Tanner of Tamworth, &amp;c.</i>,
printed at London by John Danter, 1596. This copy,
ancient as it now is, appears to have been modernized
and altered at the time it was published; and many
vestiges of the more ancient readings were recovered
from another copy (though more recently printed) in
one sheet folio, without date, in the Pepys collection."
<span class="smcap">Percy's</span> <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 87.</p>

<p>The old copies, according to Ritson, contain a great
many stanzas which Percy "has not injudiciously
suppressed." <i>King</i> Henry <i>the Fourth and the Tanner
of Tamworth</i> stands in the <i>Registers of the Stationers'
Company</i>, as licensed in 1564-5. The Tanner
of Tamworth is introduced into the First Part of Heywood's
play of <i>Edward the Fourth</i>.</p>

in Selden's <i>Titles of Honour</i>, who produces it as a good authority
to prove, that one mode of creating Esquires at that
time, was by the imposition of a collar. His words are,
"Nor is that old pamphlet of the Tanner of Tamworth and
King Edward the Fourth so contemptible, but that wee may
thence note also an observable passage, wherein the use of
making Esquires, by giving collars, is expressed." (Sub.
Tit. Esquire; &amp; vide in Spelmanni <i>Glossar. Armiger.</i>) This
form of creating Esquires actually exists at this day among
the Sergeants at Arms, who are invested with a collar (which
they wear on Collar Days) by the King himself.</p>

<h3><a name="GERNUTUS_THE_JEW_OF_VENICE" id="GERNUTUS_THE_JEW_OF_VENICE">GERNUTUS THE JEW OF VENICE.</a></h3>

<p class="center">Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, i. 224.</p>


<p>In Douce's <i>Illustrations of Shakespeare</i>, (i. 278,)
and Malone's <i>Shakespeare</i>, (v. 3, 154, ed. 1821,) we are
referred to a great many stories resembling that of the
present ballad. Two or three of these are found in
the Persian, and there can be no doubt that the original
tale is of eastern invention. The oldest European
forms of the story are in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,
(Wright's <i>Latin Stories</i>, Percy Soc. viii. 114, Madden's
<i>Old English Versions</i>, p. 130,) the French romance
of <i>Dolopathos</i> (v. 7096, <i>et seq.</i>), and the <i>Pecorone</i> of
Ser Giovanni Fiorentino, written in 1378, but not
printed till 1558.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's <i>Merchant of Venice</i> is known to have
been played before 1598, and there is some reason to
believe that it was produced as early as 1594. The
resemblance in many particulars between the play
and the narrative in the <i>Pecorone</i> is conclusive to the
fact that Shakespeare was acquainted with the Italian
novel, directly or by a translation. In Gosson's
<i>School of Abuse</i>, (1579,) mention is made of a play
called <i>The Jew</i>, in which was represented "the
greediness of worldly choosers, and bloody minds of
usurers." It is possible that Shakespeare may have
made use of the incidents of this forgotten piece in
the construction of his plot, but as our knowledge of
the older play amounts literally to the description of it
given by Gosson, nothing positive is to be said on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
point. Silvayn's <i>Orator</i>, translated from the French
by Anthony Munday in 1596, affords the earliest discovered
<i>printed</i> notice, in English, of the bond and
forfeiture, in a "Declamation, Of a Jew, who would
for his debt have a pound of flesh of a Christian;"
and a striking coincidence between the Jew's plea
for the execution of the contract, and the reasoning
of Shylock before the Senate, may be regarded by
some as of weight sufficient to offset the evidence presented
to show that the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> was on
the stage in 1594.</p>

<p>No dated copy of the ballad of <i>Gernutus</i> is known.
It is on the whole more likely that the ballad is
older than Shakespeare's comedy, but it <i>may</i> have
been called forth by the popularity of that very piece.
To judge by the first stanza alone, the writer had
derived his materials from an Italian novel.</p>

<p>We give <a href="#THE_NORTHERN_LORD_AND_CRUEL_JEW">in the Appendix</a> another ballad, presenting
considerable diversity in the incidents, which we
presume to be the one mentioned by Douce under the
title of <i>The Cruel Jews Garland</i>.</p>

<p>In 1664, we are informed by Mr. Collier, Thomas
Jordan made a ballad out of the story of the Merchant
of Venice, in his <i>Royal Arbor of Loyal Poesie</i>, taking
some liberties with the original plot.</p>

<p>The following was printed from an ancient black-letter
copy in the Pepys collection, (compared with
the Ashmole copy,) entitled,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A new Song, shewing the crueltie of 'Gernutus, a
Jewe,' who, lending to a merchant an hundred
crowns, would have a pound of his fleshe, because
he could not pay him at the time appointed. To
the tune of <i>Black and Yellow</i>."</p></div>

TINKER'S GOOD FORTUNE.</a></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, i. 255.</p></div>


<p>The story of this ballad, like that of the preceding,
was probably derived from the east. It is the same as
the tale of <i>The Sleeper Awakened</i> in the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, and a like incident is found also in the tale
of <i>Xailoun</i> in the <i>Continuation of the Arabian Nights</i>.
Interpolations from European sources are said to have
been made by the translators both of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i> and of the <i>Continuation</i>, and it has been suggested
that <i>The Sleeper Awakened</i> is one of these.
(<i>Gent. Mag.</i> 64, I. 527.) It is even true that this
story does not occur in the manuscript used by Galland.
It <i>is</i> found, however, in one manuscript, and is
accordingly admitted into the recent version.&mdash;Marco
Polo relates that Ala-eddin, "the Old Man of the
Mountain," was accustomed to employ a device resembling
that of the ballad, to persuade his youthful
votaries of his power to transport them to Paradise.
(Chap. xxi. of Marsden's translation.) A similar
anecdote is told as historically true by the Arabic
writer El-Is-hakee, who printed his work in the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
part of the 17th century (Lane's <i>Thousand and One
Nights</i>, ii. 376), while in Europe the story is related
of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, by Heuterus,
<i>Rerum Burgund.</i> lib. iv.; of the Emperor Charles the
Fifth, by Sir Richard Barckley, in <i>A Discourse on the
Felicitie of Man</i>, 1598; and of the Marquess of Worcester,
in <i>The Apothegms of King James, King Charles,
the Marquess of Worcester, &amp;c.</i> 1658. Warton had
seen among Collins's books a collection of prose tales
in black-letter, dated 1570, among which was this
story. It was until lately, and no doubt is still,
found in the stalls, under the title of <i>The Frolicksome
Courtier and the Jovial Tinker</i>. (See Douce's <i>Illustrations</i>,
and Malone's <i>Shakespeare</i>.)</p>

<p>Which of the many forms of the story was known
to the author of the old play of <i>The Taming of a
Shrew</i>, on which Shakespeare's comedy is founded, it
would be more difficult than important to determine.
Mr. Halliwell mentions a Dutch comedy, called <i>Dronkken
Hansje</i>, (1657,) having the plot of the Induction
to these plays.</p>

<p>This ballad was given from a black-letter copy in
the Pepys collection.</p>

<span class="i0">Trumpets sounding before him: thought he, this is great:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where an hour or two, pleasant walks he did view,                 <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A fine dinner was drest, both for him and his guests;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As he sat at his meat, the musick play'd sweet,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With the choicest of singing his joys to compleat.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While the tinker did dine, he had plenty of wine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like a right honest soul, faith, he took off his bowl,            <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at last he began for to tumble and roul<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Twas a point next the worst, yet perform it they must,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till at length he was brought to the duke, where he sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a pardon, as fearing he had set him at nought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his highness he said, "Thou'rt a jolly bold blade:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span><span class="i0">Such a frolick before I think never was plaid."                   <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>

<h3><a name="THE_HEIR_OF_LINNE_Percy" id="THE_HEIR_OF_LINNE_Percy">THE HEIR OF LINNE.</a></h3>


<p class="center">Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 135.</p>


<p>"The original of this ballad," says Percy, "is found
in the Editor's folio MS., the breaches and defects in
which, rendered the insertion of supplemental stanzas
necessary. These it is hoped the reader will pardon,
as indeed the completion of the story was suggested
by a modern ballad on a similar subject. From the
Scottish phrases here and there discernible in this
poem, it would seem to have been originally composed
beyond the Tweed."</p>

<p>The modern ballad here mentioned is probably <i>The
Drunkards Legacy</i>, printed from an old chap-book, in
<i>Ancient Poems, Ballads</i>, and <i>Songs</i>, p. 151, Percy Society,
vol. xvii. The Scottish version of the <i>Heir of
Linne</i> is annexed to the present in the only form in
which it is now to be obtained.</p>

<p>The incident by which the hidden treasure is discovered
in this ballad, occurs (as observes a writer in the
<i>British Bibliographer</i>, iv. 182) in a story of Cinthio's,
<i>Heccatomithi</i>, Dec. ix. nov. 8: but the argument of
that story is in other respects different, being in fact
the following epigram:</p>

<h3><a name="THE_WANDERING_JEW" id="THE_WANDERING_JEW">THE WANDERING JEW.</a></h3>


<p>In the year 1228, we are informed by Matthew
Paris, an Armenian archbishop visited England, with
letters from the Pope, to make the tour of the holy
places. During a sojourn at the monastery of St.
Albans, he was asked by one of the brethren if he
knew anything of the famous Joseph, so much spoken
of, who had been present at the crucifixion, and was
still living as a witness to the truth of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
faith. The archbishop responded that the fact was
indeed as reported, and one of his retinue added, that
his master had personally known this extraordinary
character, and had admitted him to his table only a
short time before setting out for the West; that he
had been porter to Pontius Pilate, and was named
Cartaphilus; that when the Jews were dragging Christ
from the judgment-hall, he had struck him in the
back with his fist, saying, "Go faster, Jesus: why dost
thou tarry?"&mdash;whereupon Christ turned to him and
said, "I go, but thou shalt tarry till my coming."
After the death of Jesus, Cartaphilus had been converted,
and baptized by Ananias, under the name of
Joseph. Still the sentence pronounced upon him by
the Saviour was not revoked, and he remained in the
world, awaiting the Lord's second advent, living in
Armenia, or some other country of the East. Whenever
he reached the age of a hundred, he fell into a
trance, and when he revived, found himself again
about thirty years old, as he had been at the epoch of
Christ's suffering.</p>

<p>This story Matthew Paris heard at St. Albans, of
which monastery he was himself a brother, a few
years after the memorable visit of the Armenian prelate.
His contemporary, Philippe Mouskes, Bishop of
Tournay, has incorporated the substance of his narrative
into his rhymed chronicle, edited by the Baron
de Reiffenberg, v. 25524, et seq. We hear nothing
more of the Wandering Jew from this time until
the middle of the 16th century, when he presents
himself at Hamburgh, (in 1547,) calling himself Ahasuerus,
who had been a shoemaker at Jerusalem. The
ballad which follows is founded upon some narrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of this event, many of which were published. It will
be noticed that in the second form of the legend, the
punishment of perpetual existence, which gives rise
to the old names, <i>Judæus non mortalis</i>, <i>Ewiger Jude</i>,
is aggravated by a condemnation to incessant change
of place, which is indicated by a corresponding name,
<i>Wandering Jew</i>, <i>Juif Errant</i>, etc.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary, and would be impossible, to
specify the various times and places at which the
Wandering Jew has successively reappeared. The
legend being firmly believed by the vulgar throughout
Christendom, an opportunity for imposture was
afforded which could not fail to be improved. The
last recorded apparition was at Brussels, in April,
1774, and on this occasion the wanderer had again
changed his name to Isaac Laquedem. Of the origin
of the tradition we know nothing. M. Lacroix has
suggested that it took its rise in a grand and beautiful
allegory in which the Hebrew race were personified
under the figure of the Everlasting Wanderer. See
Calmet's <i>Bible Dictionary</i>, Grässe, <i>Die Sage vom Ewigen
Juden</i>, Dresden and Leipsic, 1844, Paul Lacroix's
Bibliographical Preface to Doré's Designs, <i>La Légende
du Juif Errant, etc.</i> Paris, 1856.</p>

<p>This ballad is taken from Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 317,
and was from a black-letter copy in the Pepys collection.</p>

<h3><a name="GEORDIE_Musical_Museum" id="GEORDIE_Musical_Museum">GEORDIE.</a></h3>

<p class="center">From the <i>Musical Museum</i>, p. 357.</p>


<p>"Geordie, an old Ballad," was first printed in
Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, from a copy furnished by Burns.
The occasion of the ballad has not been satisfactorily
determined. In the opinion of Mr. Kinloch, it is to
be found in the factions of the family of Huntly
during the reign of Queen Mary. George Gordon,
Earl of Huntly, having been sent by the Queen to
apprehend a notorious robber, was thought not to
have been faithful to his trust. He returned without
accomplishing the object of his expedition, and was
committed to prison because of his failure. Some of
the Queen's council were in favor of banishing him
to France, others of putting him to death, but he was
released, on condition of paying a fine and performing
certain other stipulations. Motherwell states that
there is much variation in the recited copies of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
piece, and mentions one styled <i>Geordie Luklie</i>. Kinloch
prints a version not materially different from that
of the <i>Museum</i>. Allan Cunningham has reprinted
the Museum copy with less change than is customary
with him; <i>Songs of Scotland</i>, ii. 186. We give in the
Appendix a ballad from Buchan, called <a href="#GIGHTS_LADY_Appendix_to_p_93"><i>Gight's Lady</i></a>,
which contains a story widely diverse from that which
follows. In Ritson's <i>Northumberland Garland</i>, p. 43,
there is a "lamentable ditty" on the death of one
George Stoole, which appears to be an imitation of
the Scottish ballad.</p>

<p class="center">Tea-Table Miscellany, i. 104; <i>Old Ballads</i>, iii. 259.</p>

<p>It is tradition that King James the Fifth of Scotland
was in the habit of wandering about his dominions
in disguise, and engaging in amours with country
girls. One of these is thought to be described in the
witty ballad of <i>The Jolly Beggar</i>, (Herd's <i>Scotish
Songs</i>, ii. 164, Ritson's <i>Scotish Songs</i>, i. 168,) and
another in <i>The Gaberlunzie-Man</i>, both of which are
universally attributed (though without evidence) to
James's pen. The character of James V., it has been
remarked (<i>Gent. Mag.</i> Oct. 1794, p. 913,) resembled
both in licentiousness and genius, that of the troubadour
sovereign, William the Ninth, Count of Poitiers,
who appears to have had the same vagrant habits.</p>

<p>With <i>The Jolly Beggar</i> may be compared <i>Der Bettelmann</i>,
in Hoffmann's <i>Schlesische Volkslieder</i>, p. 45.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_TURNAMENT_OF_TOTENHAM" id="THE_TURNAMENT_OF_TOTENHAM">THE TURNAMENT OF TOTENHAM.</a></h3>


<p><i>The Turnament of Totenham</i> was first printed in
the <i>History of Totenham</i>, (1631,) by the Rev. Wilhelm
Bedwell, rector of the parish, who, says Percy,
"so little entered into the spirit of the poem he was
publishing, that he contends for its being a serious
narrative of a real event, and thinks it must have
been written before the time of Edward III., because
turnaments were prohibited in that reign." The simple
parson derived his copy from a manuscript lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
him by George Withers. In the first edition of the
<i>Reliques</i>, Percy reprinted Bedwell's text, with some
conjectural emendations, but for the revised edition
he employed a manuscript in the Harleian collection
(No. 5396), pointed out to him by Tyrwhitt. This
manuscript is thought to have been written in the
reign of Henry VI. Since the publication of the
Harleian text, the manuscript used by Bedwell has
been found in the Public Library of the University
of Cambridge, (Ff. 5, 48,) and a correct copy published
by Mr. Wright in a miniature volume. We
have given this last text, as on the whole the best,
though in places it requires emendation from the
Harleian copy. The Cambridge manuscript (the
same as that which contains the ballad of <i>Robin Hood
and the Monk</i>,) Mr. Wright believes to have been
written as early as the reign of Edward II. In this
MS. there is subjoined to the <i>Turnament</i> an extravagantly
burlesque account of the feast mentioned in
the last stanzas.</p>

<p>Percy's copy will be found in the <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 13.
Ritson's (<i>Ancient English Songs</i>, i. 85,) is nearly identical.</p>

<p>This ballad, it has been observed, appears to be "a
burlesque upon the old feudal custom of marrying an
heiress to the knight who should vanquish all his
opponents, at a solemn assembly holden for that purpose."
See the remarks in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
for July, 1794, p. 613.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_WYF_OF_AUCHTIRMUCHTY" id="THE_WYF_OF_AUCHTIRMUCHTY">THE WYF OF AUCHTIRMUCHTY.</a></h3>


<p>This ballad has been handed down, through manuscript
and oral tradition, in several forms. The oldest
copy is furnished by the Bannatyne MS., and this has
been often printed, with more or less correctness: as
in Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>, ii. 137; Lord Hailes's <i>Ancient
Scotish Poems, &amp;c.</i> p. 215; Herd's <i>Scotish Songs</i>, ii.
237; Pinkerton's <i>Select Scottish Ballads</i>, ii. 97. Our
text is that of Laing, <i>Select Remains, &amp;c.</i>, which professes
to be carefully given from the manuscript. Mr.
Laing has added in the margin the most important
variations of other editions. Allan Ramsay altered
several verses and added others.</p>

<p>In the Bannatyne MS. this piece is subscribed with
the name of "Mofat," and on this ground the authorship
has been attributed to Sir John Moffat, who is
supposed to have lived in the earlier part of the 16th
century.</p>

<p>Ritson, who intended to insert the <i>Wife of Auchtermuchty</i>
in a projected volume of <i>Select Scotish
Poems</i>, says in a manuscript note, "The subject of
this poem seems to be borrowed from the first part of
a story in the <i>Silva Sermonum Jucundissimorum</i>, Basil.
1568, 8vo. p. 116, though certainly from a more ancient
authority." (Laing.) This story is cited at the end
of the volume from which we print. In Wright and
Halliwell's <i>Reliquiæ Antiquæ</i>, ii. 195, is the first <i>fit</i>
of an English ballad on the same subject, "from a
MS. on paper, of the reign of Henry VII," (<i>Ballad
of a Tyrannical Husband</i>.) <i>John Grumlie</i> in Cun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>ningham's
<i>Songs of Scotland</i>, ii. 123, is another variety.
See also <i>Nursery Rhymes of England</i>, p. 32, Per. Soc.
vol. iv. In 1803, there appeared at Edinburgh a translation
of Ramsay's ballad into Latin rhyme.</p>

<p>An old story, often referred to, e. g. in Skelton's
<i>Colyn Cloute</i>, v. 879. The ballad is found in various
collections in the British Museum, and is cited in part

There is a Scottish version in Kinloch's <i>Ballad

<p class="center">Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, ii. 63.</p>


<p>First printed by Herd in a slightly different form,
ed. 1776, ii. 159; also Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, p. 310, and
Ritson's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 226. The hero of this
story is traditionally known as one Johnie Blunt, who
lived on Crawford Moor. Several versions of a song
called by his name are current among the Scottish
peasantry, one of which is given in Johnson's <i>Museum</i>,
p. 376.&mdash;This ballad, says Stenhouse, furnished Prince
Hoare with one of the principal scenes in his musical
entertainment of <i>No Song, no Supper</i>, "acted at Drury
Lane in 1790, and since throughout the United Kingdom
with great success."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DRAGON_OF_WANTLEY" id="THE_DRAGON_OF_WANTLEY">THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY.</a></h3>

<p class="center">Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, iii. 350. <i>Old Ballads</i>, i. 37.</p>


<p>This in its way most admirable ballad is clearly a
parody of some ancient <i>K[oe]mpevise</i>. The armor studded
with spikes connects this story with the legend of
the <i>Worm of Lambton</i> (see vol. i. p. 281, and <i>post</i>, p.
136), which, we are inclined to think with Grundtvig
(i. 346), may have some radical connection with Regner
Lodbrog's fight with the snake that guarded Thora's
bower. The well in v. 100 corresponds to the pit
in which the hero stands in <i>Ormekampen</i>, Grundtvig,
i. 342.&mdash;Printed by Percy from a copy in Roman letter,
in the Pepys Collection, "collated with such others
as could be procured." <span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>

<p>&#8258; In the improved edition of the <i>Reliques</i>, a most extraordinary
attempt to explain the foregoing burlesque as
an allegory (!) is made in a "Key" appended to the ballad,
and said to be "communicated by Godfrey Bosville, Esq., of
Thorp, near Malton, in Yorkshire."</p>

<p>"Warncliff Lodge, and Warncliff Wood (vulgarly pronounced
Wantley), are in the parish of Penniston, in Yorkshire.
The rectory of Penniston was part of the dissolved
monastery of St. Stephen's, Westminster; and was granted
to the Duke of Norfolk's family: who therewith endowed an
hospital, which he built at Sheffield, for women. The trustees
let the impropriation of the great tithes of Penniston to
the Wortley family, who got a great deal by it, and wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to get still more: for Mr. Nicholas Wortley attempted to take
the tithes in kind, but Mr. Francis Bosville opposed him, and
there was a decree in favour of the modus in 37th Eliz. The
vicarage of Penniston did not go along with the rectory, but
with the copyhold rents, and was part of a large purchase
made by Ralph Bosville, Esq., from Queen Elizabeth, in the
2d year of her reign: and that part he sold in 12th Eliz. to
his elder brother Godfrey, the father of Francis; who left it,
with the rest of his estate, to his wife, for her life, and then
to Ralph, third son of his uncle Ralph. The widow married
Lyonel Rowlestone, lived eighteen years, and survived Ralph.</p>

<p>"This premised, the ballad apparently relates to the lawsuit
carried on concerning this claim of tithes made by the
Wortley family. 'Houses and churches were to him geese
and turkeys:' which are titheable things, the Dragon chose
to live on. Sir Francis Wortley, the son of Nicholas, attempted
again to take the tithes in kind: but the parishioners
subscribed an agreement to defend their modus. And at
the head of the agreement was Lyonel Rowlestone, who is
supposed to be one of 'the stones, dear Jack, which the
Dragon could not crack.' The agreement is still preserved
in a large sheet of parchment, dated 1st of James I., and is
full of names and seals, which might be meant by the coat
of armour, "with spikes all about, both within and without."
More of More-hall was either the attorney, or counsellor,
who conducted the suit. He is not distinctly remembered,
but More-hall is still extant at the very bottom of Wantley
[Warncliff] Wood, and lies so low, that it might be said to be
in a well: as the Dragon's den [Warncliff Lodge] was at the
top of the wood 'with Matthew's house hard by it.' The
keepers belonging to the Wortley family were named, for
many generations, Matthew Northall: the last of them left
this lodge, within memory, to be keeper to the Duke of Norfolk.
The present owner of More-hall still attends Mr. Bosville's
Manor Court at Oxspring, and pays a rose a year.
'More of More-Hall, with nothing at all, slew the Dragon of
Wantley.' He gave him, instead of tithes, so small a modus,
that it was in effect, nothing at all, and was slaying him with
a vengeance. 'The poor children three,' &amp;c., cannot surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
mean the three sisters of Francis Bosville, who would have
been coheiresses, had he made no will? The late Mr. Bosville
had a contest with the descendants of two of them, the
late Sir George Saville's father, and Mr. Copley, about the
presentation to Penniston, they supposing Francis had not
the power to give this part of the estate from the heirs at
law; but it was decided against them. The Dragon (Sir
Francis Wortley) succeeded better with his cousin Wordesworth,
the freehold lord of the manor, (for it is the copyhold
manor that belongs to Mr. Bosville,) having persuaded him
not to join the refractory parishioners, under a promise that
he would let him his tithes cheap: and now the estates of
Wortley and Wordesworth are the only lands that pay tithes
in the parish.</p>

125, as the duration of the combat, was probably that of the
trial at law."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> to p. 128, and p. 131, v. 75-80. Grundtvig, ii. 653,
refers to a B[oe]otian legend in Pausanias ix. 26, 5, for an instance
of a similar contrivance. The story goes, that one
Menestratus, to save a friend who was about to be exposed
in due course to a dragon, made himself a brazen breastplate,
which had on every scale a hook with the point bent
upwards. Armed in this, he went voluntarily to meet the
monster, and destroyed him, though at the expense of his
own life.</p>

<p>There is a resemblance in two points between this
ballad and the Danish <i>Greve Genselin</i> (Grundtvig, No.
16, translated by Jamieson, <i>Illustrations</i>, p. 310).
The characters in both are giants: the smallest kemp
that danced at Genselin's bridal was "fifteen ells to his
knee." Secondly, the bridal in the one ballad and
the wooing in the other are described in a style of extravagant
parody; more gross in the English, however,
than in the Danish, where it is confined to the
bride's enormous appetite. This portion of <i>Greve
Genselin</i> occurs also in <i>Tord af Havsgaard</i> (Grundtvig,
No. 1), which ballad is founded upon the story of
Thor's Hammer in the <i>Edda</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the
Peasantry of England</i>, edited by Robert Bell, p. 124.
This ballad, says the editor, "has long been popular
in Worcestershire and some of the adjoining counties.
It was printed for the first time by Mr. Allies of Worcester,
under the title of <i>The Jovial Hunter of Bromsgrove</i>;
but amongst the peasantry of that county, and
the adjoining county of Warwick, it has always been
called <i>The Old Man and his Three Sons</i>&mdash;the name
given to a fragment of the ballad still used as a nursery
song in the north of England, the chorus of
which slightly varies from that of the ballad: (see
p. 250 of the same publication.)" Mr. Bell imagines
that there is an allusion to this ballad in <i>As You Like
It</i>, i. 2, where Le Beau says</p>

<p class="center">Evans's <i>Old Ballads</i>, i. 277; Collection of 1723, ii. 173.</p>


<p>This excellent ballad, to adopt the encomium of
Addison, (<i>Spectator</i>, No. 247,) was admitted by Percy
into the earlier editions of the <i>Reliques</i>, (iii. 146, 1st
ed.) though excluded from the revised edition of
1794. The same story circulates among the peasantry
of England and Scotland in the form of a
penny tract or chap-book; <i>Notices of Popular Histories</i>,
p. 16, Percy Soc. vol. xxiii., <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
New Series, vol. iii. p. 49. The jest is an old one.
Mr. Halliwell refers to a <i>fabliau</i> in Barbazan's collection,
which contains the groundwork of this piece;

<h3><a name="THE_GENTLEMAN_IN_THRACIA" id="THE_GENTLEMAN_IN_THRACIA">THE GENTLEMAN IN THRACIA.</a></h3>

<p class="center">From Collier's <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i>, p. 17.</p>


<p>This ballad is founded on a tale in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,
(<i>Old English Versions</i>, &amp;c. p. 140.) Nearly
the same story occurs in Barbazan's <i>Fabliaux</i>, ii. 440,
and also, says Madden, in the <i>Contes Tartares</i> of
Gueulette, iii. 157, and many other places. The
model for all these is of course the Judgment of Solomon,
in <i>1 Kings</i>, iii. 16-27. See Douce, ii. 385.</p>

<p>Mr. Collier remarks that this ballad is without date,
but was undoubtedly written late in the sixteenth, or
early in the seventeenth, century.</p>

<h3><a name="SIR_RICHARD_WHITTINGTONS" id="SIR_RICHARD_WHITTINGTONS">SIR RICHARD WHITTINGTON'S
ADVANCEMENT.</a></h3>


<p>This ballad is taken from <i>The Crowne-Garland
of Golden Roses</i>, p. 20, Percy Society, vol. vi. Another
copy is in <i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, i. 130.
A play called <i>The History of Whittington</i> was entered
on the Stationers' books in Feb. 1604, and the "famous
fable of Whittington and his puss" is mentioned
in <i>Eastward Hoe</i>, 1605. (Weber and Halliwell.)</p>

<p>"There is something so fabulous," (says the editor
of <i>Old Ballads</i>, following Grafton and Stow,) "or at
least, that has such a romantic appearance, in the
history of Whittington, that I shall not choose to
relate it; but refer my credulous readers to common
tradition, or to the penny histories. Certain it is
that there was such a man; a citizen of London, by
trade a mercer, and one who has left public edifices
and charitable works enow behind him, to transmit
his name to posterity. Amongst others, he founded a
house of prayer; with an allowance for a master, fellows,
choristers, clerks, &amp;c., and an almshouse for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
thirteen poor men, called Whittington College. He
entirely rebuilt the loathsome prison, which then was
standing at the west gate of the city, and called it
Newgate. He built the better half of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, in West-Smithfield, and the fine
library in Grey-Fryars, now called Christ's Hospital:
as also great part of the east end of Guildhall, with a
chapel, and a library in which the records of the city
might be kept.... 'Tis said of him, that he advanced
a very considerable sum of money towards carrying
on the war in France, under this last monarch. He
married Alice, the daughter of Hugh and Molde Fitzwarren:
at whose house, traditions say, Whittington
lived a servant, when he got his immense riches by
venturing his cat in one of his master's ships. However,
if we may give credit to his own will, he was a
knight's son; and more obliged to an English king
and prince, than to any African monarch, for his
riches. For when he founded Whittington College,
and left a maintenance for so many people, as above
related, they were, as Stow records it, for this maintenance
bound to pray for the good estate of Richard
Whittington, and Alice his wife, their founders; and
for Sir William Whittington, and Dame Joan his
wife; and for Hugh Fitzwarren, and Dame Molde his
wife; the fathers and mothers of the said Richard
Whittington and Alice his wife; for King Richard
the Second, and Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of
Gloucester, special lords and promoters of the said
Richard Whittington, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Richard Whittington was Sheriff of London in the
18th year of Richard the Second, 1394, was then
knighted, and chosen Mayor in the 22d year of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
same reign, 1398. He was again Mayor in the 9th
year of Henry the Fourth, 1407, and the 8th of Henry
the Fifth, 1420.</p>

<p>Keightley has devoted a chapter of his <i>Tales and
Popular Fictions</i> (the seventh) to the legend of
Whittington and his Cat. He cites two similar stories
from Thiele's <i>Danish Popular Traditions</i>, another
from the letters of Count Magalotti, a Florentine of
the latter half of the 17th century, another from the
<i>Facezie</i> of Arlotto, a Tuscan humorist of the 15th
century, another, of Venetian origin, from a German
chronicle of the 13th century, and finally one from
the Persian <i>Tarikh al Wasaf</i>, a work said to have
been composed at the end of the 13th or the beginning
of the 14th century. Mr. Halliwell adds one
more of a Portuguese wrecked on the coast of Guinea,
from the <i>Description of Guinea</i>, 1665.</p>

<p>Only in a very debased form is this enchanting
tale preserved by English tradition. The following
ballad is given, in the collection cited above, from a
modern broadside, but has here received a few improvements
from two other copies cited by the editor.
Mr. Halliwell has printed another version of
Catskin in <i>The Nursery Rhymes of England</i>, p. 48,
Percy Society, vol. iv. The story is possessed by
almost every nation in Europe. It is found not only
among the Northern races, but among the Hungarians,
Servians, Wallachians, Welsh, Italians, and French. In
Germany it is current in a great variety of forms, the
two most noteworthy of which are <i>Aschenputtel</i>, to
which correspond <i>Cennerentola</i> in the <i>Pentamerone</i>
(i. 6), the <i>Cendrillon</i> of Perrault, and the <i>Finette
Cendron</i> of Madame d'Aulnoy; and <i>Allerlei-Rauh</i>,
which is the same as the <i>Peau d'Ane</i> of Perrault, the

<h3><a name="TITUS_ANDRONICUSS_COMPLAINT" id="TITUS_ANDRONICUSS_COMPLAINT">TITUS ANDRONICUS'S COMPLAINT.</a></h3>


<p>On the 6th of February, 1593-4, <i>A noble Roman
Historye of Tytus Andronicus</i>, was entered in the
Stationers' Registers, to John Danter, and also "the
ballad thereof." The earliest known edition of Shakespeare's
play was in 1600. The differences between
this play and the ballad are thus stated by Percy.</p>

<p>"In the ballad is no mention of the contest for
the empire between the two brothers, the composing
of which makes the ungrateful treatment of Titus
afterwards the more flagrant: neither is there any
notice taken of his sacrificing one of Tamora's sons,
which the tragic poet has assigned as the original
cause of all her cruelties. In the play, Titus loses
twenty-one of his sons in war, and kills another for
assisting Bassianus to carry off Lavinia; the reader
will find it different in the ballad. In the latter she
is betrothed to the Emperor's son: in the play to his
brother. In the tragedy, only two of his sons fall
into the pit, and the third, being banished, returns
to Rome with a victorious army, to avenge the wrongs
of his house: in the ballad, all three are entrapped,
and suffer death. In the scene, the Emperor kills
Titus, and is in return stabbed by Titus's surviving
son. Here Titus kills the Emperor, and afterwards
himself." * * * * *</p>

<h3><a name="JOHN_DORY" id="JOHN_DORY">JOHN DORY.</a></h3>


<p>This ballad, formerly a very great favorite, and
continually alluded to in works of the 16th and
17th centuries, is found among the "Freemen's Songs
of three voices" in <i>Deuteromelia</i>, 1609; also in Playford's
<i>Musical Companion</i>, 1687, and for one voice in
<i>Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>, vol. i.
1698 and 1707. It is, however, much older than any
of these books.</p>

<p>Carew, in his <i>Survey of Cornwall</i>, 1602, p. 135,
writes: "Moreover, the prowess of one Nicholas, son
to a widow near Foy, is descanted upon in an old
three-man's song, namely, how he fought bravely at
sea with John Dory, (a Genowey, as I conjecture,)
set forth by John, the French King, and, after much
bloodshed on both sides, took, and slew him, in revenge
of the great ravine and cruelty which he had fore
committed upon the Englishmen's goods and bodies."
The only King John that could be meant here is of
course John II. the Good, (see v. 10,) who was taken
prisoner at Poitiers, and died in 1364. No John Doria
is mentioned as being in the service of John the Good.&mdash;Ritson's
<i>Ancient Songs</i>, ii. 57, and Chappell's <i>Popular
Music</i>, p. 67.</p>

<p>We have thought it necessary to include in this
collection one or two specimens of ballads founded
on stories in the Jewish Scriptures. Besides those
here selected, it may be well to refer to the following:
<i>The Constancy of Susanna</i>, (cited in <i>Twelfth Night</i>,)
Evans, i. 11; <i>David and Bathsheba</i>, <i>id.</i> p. 291; <i>Tobias</i>,
<i>Old Ballads</i>, ii. 158; <i>Holofernes</i>, <i>The Garland of
Goodwill</i>, p. 85, and <i>Old Ballads</i>, ii. 166.</p>

<p>Every one will remember that the ballad of <i>Jephthah</i>
is quoted in <i>Hamlet</i> (Act II. sc. 2). Percy published
an imperfect copy of this piece, written down
from the recollection of a lady (<i>Reliques</i>, i. 193). The
following is from a black-letter copy reprinted in
Evans, i. 7, which was entitled "<i>Jepha, Judge of
Israel</i>."</p>

<h3><a name="GEORGE_BARNWELL" id="GEORGE_BARNWELL">GEORGE BARNWELL.</a></h3>

<p class="center">Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, iii. 297.</p>


<p>"The subject of this ballad is sufficiently popular
from the modern play which is founded upon it. This
was written by George Lillo, a jeweller of London,
and first acted about 1730.&mdash;As for the ballad, it was
printed at least as early as the middle of the last century.</p>

<p>"It is here given from three old printed copies,
which exhibit a strange intermixture of Roman and
black-letter. It is also collated with another copy in
the Ashmole Collection at Oxford, which is thus entitled:
"<i>An excellent ballad of George Barnwell, an
apprentice of London, who ... thrice robbed his master,
and murdered his uncle in Ludlow</i>. The tune is
<i>The Merchant</i>."</p>

<p>There is another copy in Ritson's <i>Ancient Songs</i>,
ii. 156. Throughout the Second Part, the first line
of each stanza has, in the old editions, two superfluous
syllables, which Percy ejected; and Ritson has adopted
the emendation.</p>

wrought the death of one hundred men.</p></div>

<p>"Craignargat is a promontory in the Bay of Luce.
Though almost surrounded by the Barony of Mochrum,
it was long possessed by a branch of the family
of Macdowall, which was probably our heroine's surname.&mdash;On
the head of Fair Margaret's lovers, it
may be remarked, that the Agnews of Lochnaw are a
very ancient family, and hereditary sheriffs of Wigton.
The Gordon mentioned was probably Gordon
of Craighlaw, whose castle was situated about five
miles from Craignargat, in the parish of Kirkcowan,
considered so remote before the formation of military
roads, that the local proverb says,&mdash;'Out of the
world, and into Kirkcowan.' The Hays of Park
dwell on the coast, about six miles from Craignargat;
but it is singular that the lady is not complimented
with a Dunbar as her lover, the Place of Mochrum,
as the old town is called, being only two miles from
her reputed residence." Sharpe's <i>Ballad Book</i>, p. 71.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_FARMERS_OLD_WIFE" id="THE_FARMERS_OLD_WIFE">THE FARMER'S OLD WIFE.</a></h3>


<p><i>The Carl of Kellyburn Braes</i>, composed by Burns
for Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, (p. 392,) was founded, he
says, "on the old traditionary verses." These we
have met with in no other form but the following,
which is taken from <i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and
Songs of the Peasantry of England</i>, edited by Robert
Bell, p. 204. What is styled the original of <i>The
Carle of Kellyburn Braes</i>, in Cromek's <i>Remains of
Nithsdale and Galloway Song</i>, p. 83, is, like many of
the pieces in that volume, for the most part a fabrication.
The place of the burden is supplied in Sussex,
says Mr. Bell, by a whistling chorus.</p>

<p>Of the same tenor is the ballad of <i>The Devil and
the Scold</i>, Collier's <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i>, p. 35.</p>

<p>We subjoin the first stanza of Burns's ballad for
the sake of the burden, which is said to be old.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DUEL_OF_WHARTON_AND_STUART" id="THE_DUEL_OF_WHARTON_AND_STUART">THE DUEL OF WHARTON AND STUART.</a></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, iii. 77.</p>


<p>The unhappy event upon which the following ballad
is founded took place under the reign of James
the VI.</p>

<p>"The sufferers in this melancholy affair were both
men of high birth, the heirs-apparent of two noble
families, and youths of the most promising expectation.
Sir James Stuart was a knight of the Bath, and
eldest son of Walter, first Lord Blantyre, by Nicholas,
daughter of Sir James Somerville of Cambusnethan.
Sir George Wharton was also a knight of the Bath,
and eldest son of Philip, Lord Wharton, by Frances,
daughter of Henry Clifford, Earl of Cumberland.
He married Anne, daughter of the Earl of Rutland,
but left no issue." <span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

<p>This ballad was printed in the first edition of Ritson's
<i>Ancient Songs</i>, p. 199, from a black-letter copy
in Major Pearson's collection, (afterwards part of the
Roxburghe.) Scott's version appears to have been
obtained from James Hogg. "Two verses have been
added," says Sir Walter, "and one considerably improved,
from Mr. Ritson's edition. These three stanzas
are the fifth and ninth of Part First, and the penult
verse of Part Second. I am thus particular, that the
reader may be able, if he pleases, to compare the
traditional ballad with the original edition. It furnishes
striking evidence, that 'without characters,
fame lives long.' The difference chiefly to be re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>marked
betwixt the copies, lies in the dialect, and in
some modifications applicable to Scotland; as, using
the words "our Scottish Knight." The black-letter
ballad, in like manner, terms Wharton "our English
Knight."</p>

<p>In this connection we may mention another ballad
founded on a duel&mdash;<i>Sir Niel and Mac Van</i>, in Buchan's
larger collection, ii. 16. A stall copy is called
<i>Sir Neil and Glengyle</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Appendix to p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>.</p>

<p class="center">From Buchan's <i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>, i. 133.</p>


<p>Buchan complains that all other editions of this
ballad "have been deprived of their original beauty
and catastrophe" by officious and sacrilegious hands,
and adds that his copy "is quite at variance with all
its printed predecessors." In this last remark he is
certainly correct, but as for his affirmation that the
ballad "recounts an affair which actually took place
in the reign, or rather minority, of King James VI.,"
we ask for some authority beyond his note to the
ballad.</p>

<p>In another copy mentioned by Motherwell, Geordie,
from jealousy, ungratefully drowns his deliverer in
the sea.</p>
